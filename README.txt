Welcome to UsefulApp!
This is my first GitHub Project
This is a hackable Python GUI application that uses Tkinter. Even though it is a very simple app, you can mod it and create a GitHub request (at your own wish)
and suggest changes that come with the base file
You can modify the code, give suggestions and improve this README document
Please leave suggestions, issues and more on the GitHub page ---> https://github.com/Dedsec2309/UsefulApp
Also, by using this program, you agree to the GPL 3.0 License
Enjoy!
